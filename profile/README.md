## Simtools - Tools, applications, and workflows for the Simulation System of the CTA Observatory. 

The CTA Simulation Production Pipeline (SimPipe) is the system responsible for simulating the response of [Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTAO)](https://www.cta-observatory.org) telescopes
and modeling the relevant air shower physics and atmospheric conditions. 
It comprises several simulation software packages, a model of all components relevant to the measurement process, and tools for deriving and validating these model parameters.
This project collects tools, applications, and workflows for the CTAO SimPipe.
